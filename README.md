Java 8 Lambda Exercises for OODP 2014


Lab Exercises
Worksheet: Lambda Expressions
You should start by importing the appropriate project into your IDE. Project files are provided for Eclipse and IntelliJ on the repo. All the following questions should be answered using the new Java 8 lambda expressions.
1. Create an array containing some Strings. Sort the array by
• length (i.e., shortest to longest)
• reverse length (i.e., longest to shortest)
• first character
• Strings that contain “e” first, everything else second.
Remember that the compare method of Comparator should return a negative number if the first entry is less than the second, a positive number if the first entry is greater than the second, and 0 if they are the same. See the JavaDoc API for details.
To print out an array after sorting, consider using
         System.out.println(Arrays.asList(yourArray))
The point of this is that if you just print an array directly, you do not see anything useful (just the memory address), but if you print a List, it shows the individual elements separated by commas. So, the above trick is simpler than creating a loop to traverse the array and print
out the elements.
2. For the last sorting example (strings with “e” first), move the logic that computes the number
to a separate static method. For example, StringUtils.eChecker(s1, s2)
will return
• -1 if s1 is less (i.e., it contains “e” but s2 doesn’t), • 1 if s1 is greater, and
• 0 otherwise.
Now, rewrite the final lambda sorting example, but use a method reference in place of an explicit lambda.

3. Create a class with a static method called betterString. This method should take two Strings and a lambda as its arguments. This lambda states whether the first of the two strings is better.
The method should return the better string; i.e., if the lambda returns true the method should return the first string, otherwise it should return the second string.
For the lambda, define an interface called TwoStringPredicate with a method that takes two Strings and returns true if the first is better than the second, false otherwise.
Here are two examples (the first returns whichever of test1 and test2 is longer, and the second always returns test1):
• StringUtils.betterString(test1, test2, (s1, s2) -> s1.length() > s2.length()) • StringUtils.betterString(test1, test2, (s1, s2) -> true)
4. Use generics to replace betterString with betterEntry and TwoStringPredicate with TwoElementPredicate. Make sure your previous examples still work when you only change betterString to betterElement.
5. Create a static method called allMatches. It should take a List of Strings and a Predicate<String>, and return a new List of all the values that passed the test. Test it with several examples. E.g.:
• List<String> shortWords = StringUtils.allMatches(words, s -> s.length() < 4);
• List<String> wordsWithB = StringUtils.allMatches(words, s -> s.contains("b"));
• List<String> evenLengthWords = StringUtils.allMatches(words, s -> (s.length() % 2) == 0);
6. Rewrite allMatches so it works on any List and associated Predicate, not just on Strings. Verify that your examples from the previous question still work.
7. Create a static method called transformedList. It should take a List of Strings and a Function<String,String> and return a new List that contains the results of applying the function to each element of the original list. E.g.:
• List<String> excitingWords = StringUtils.transformedList(words, s -> s + "");!
• List<String> eyeWords =
       StringUtils.transformedList(words, s -> s.replace("i", "eye"));
• List<String> upperCaseWords = StringUtils.transformedList(words, String::toUpperCase);
8. Rewrite transformedList so it works with generic types. Verify that your examples from the previous question still work.
